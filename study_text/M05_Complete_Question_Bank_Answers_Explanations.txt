STANDARD FORMAT QUESTIONS (Q1-Q40)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1 [Learning Outcome 1.1]
Which two branches of civil law have most relevance in the context of insurance?
A. Contract and property.
B. Contract and torts.
C. Property and trusts.
D. Torts and trusts.

Answer: B
Explanation: Insurance law primarily operates at the intersection of contract law and tort law. Contract law governs the relationship between the insurer and insured (the insurance policy is a contract), whilst tort law is relevant because many insurance claims arise from tortious liability (e.g., negligence claims in motor or liability insurance). Property law and trusts, whilst occasionally relevant, are not the primary branches underpinning insurance operations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2 [Learning Outcome 1.2]
Minor civil cases relating to personal injury claims are usually dealt with by the
A. County Courts.
B. Court of Appeal.
C. Divisional Courts of the High Court.
D. Magistrates Courts.

Answer: A
Explanation: The court system in England and Wales has a hierarchical structure. County Courts handle the majority of civil cases, including minor personal injury claims (typically those valued below £50,000). The Court of Appeal is an appellate court, the High Court deals with more complex or high-value cases, and Magistrates Courts primarily handle criminal matters and some family law issues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3 [Learning Outcome 1.5]
What legal personality best describes a person who is subject to a bankruptcy order?
A. A corporation sole.
B. A juristic person.
C. A member of an unincorporated association.
D. A natural legal person.

Answer: D
Explanation: A natural legal person is a human being with legal rights and obligations. Bankruptcy affects a natural person's capacity to contract and manage their financial affairs, but they remain a natural legal person. A corporation sole is a specific type of legal entity (like the Crown), a juristic person is an artificial legal entity (like a company), and an unincorporated association is a group without separate legal personality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4 [Learning Outcome 1.4]
Which is a characteristic of criminal procedure?
A. A criminal court case is a contest between the prosecution and the defence.
B. Criminal proceedings follow the continental European inquisitorial system.
C. Guilt of a crime must be proven on the 'balance of probabilities'.
D. The legal process for criminal cases is always trial by judge and jury.

Answer: A
Explanation: English criminal procedure follows an adversarial system where prosecution and defence present their cases before an independent judge or jury. This differs from the inquisitorial system used in some European countries. Criminal cases require proof 'beyond reasonable doubt' (not balance of probabilities, which is the civil standard). Not all criminal cases involve jury trials – many are decided by magistrates alone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5 [Learning Outcome 2.2]
In negligence, what standard of care would be required of a newly-qualified electrician?
A. The standard for the electrical profession only.
B. The standard for the electrical profession but with an allowance for level of experience.
C. The standard of a prudent man.
D. The standard of a reasonable man.

Answer: A
Explanation: In negligence, professionals are judged against the standard of a reasonably competent practitioner in their field, not against an ordinary person. This is the principle from Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee. A newly-qualified electrician must meet the same professional standard as an experienced electrician – there is no allowance for inexperience when holding oneself out as a professional. The 'reasonable man' test applies to non-professionals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 6 [Learning Outcome 2.2]
One of the requirements for a claimant to succeed in an action for trespass to the person is
A. intention.
B. negligence.
C. prescription.
D. recklessness.

Answer: A
Explanation: Trespass to the person (including assault, battery, and false imprisonment) requires intentional conduct by the defendant. The tort is actionable per se (without proof of damage). Negligence is a separate tort requiring proof of damage. Prescription relates to acquiring rights through long use. Recklessness may suffice for some purposes but the traditional requirement is intention.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 7 [Learning Outcome 2.4]
What is the common law remedy for the tort of nuisance?
A. Exemplary damages.
B. General damages.
C. An injunction.
D. Restitution.

Answer: B
Explanation: The primary common law remedy for nuisance is damages (compensation). General damages compensate for losses that don't have a specific monetary value, such as loss of amenity or enjoyment of property. An injunction is an equitable remedy (not common law) that orders the defendant to stop the nuisance. Exemplary damages are rare punitive awards. Restitution aims to restore something taken, which is not the primary remedy in nuisance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 8 [Learning Outcome 3.9]
A gardener who was entitled to £2,000 under a contract with a private client assigned her rights under the contract to one of her plant suppliers. To be legally valid as a statutory assignment, this assignment must be
A. absolute.
B. conditional.
C. a contract under seal.
D. supported by consideration.

Answer: A
Explanation: Under s.136 of the Law of Property Act 1925, a statutory (legal) assignment must be: (1) absolute (not conditional or partial), (2) in writing, (3) with written notice given to the debtor. An absolute assignment transfers all rights unconditionally. Equitable assignments can be conditional or partial but require the assignor to be joined in any legal action. Consideration is not required for an assignment (it's not a contract itself). A deed is not necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 9 [Learning Outcome 3.6]
After what period of time does an action for breach of a simple contract become statute-barred if the action is NOT in respect of personal injuries?
A. 1 year.
B. 3 years.
C. 6 years.
D. 12 years.

Answer: C
Explanation: The Limitation Act 1980 sets time limits for bringing legal actions. For simple contracts (not under seal), the limitation period is 6 years from the date the cause of action accrued. For personal injury claims, the period is 3 years. For contracts under seal (deeds), the period is 12 years. Once statute-barred, the claim cannot be pursued through the courts (though the debt may still technically exist).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 10 [Learning Outcome 3.2]
A gratuitous promise is contractually valid and binding on the promissor when it is
A. accepted by a minor.
B. a domestic or social arrangement.
C. presented in writing.
D. in the form of a deed.

Answer: D
Explanation: A gratuitous promise (one without consideration) is generally not enforceable under contract law because consideration is a required element. However, a deed (formerly 'contract under seal') does not require consideration to be binding. Simply writing down a promise doesn't make it binding without consideration. Acceptance by a minor doesn't solve the consideration problem. Domestic and social arrangements are generally presumed not to create legal relations even if consideration exists.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 11 [Learning Outcome 4.2]
An agent may be able to protect his rights to remuneration and indemnity by
A. accepting commission from both parties to a transaction.
B. accounting for the principal's money separately.
C. exercising a lien on the principal's property.
D. signing a negotiable instrument on behalf of the principal.

Answer: C
Explanation: A lien is a right to retain possession of property until a debt is paid. Agents may have a particular lien over their principal's property in their possession to secure unpaid commission or expenses. Accepting commission from both parties breaches the agent's duty of loyalty. Accounting for money separately is a duty, not a right. Signing negotiable instruments is an agency power but doesn't protect the agent's right to remuneration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 12 [Learning Outcome 4.4]
A personal assistant regularly books accommodation at a particular hotel on behalf of her employer. On one occasion, she also booked a hotel room for her husband and herself without her employer's permission. What principle of agency law could make the employer liable to the hotel for payment of the room charge?
A. Breach of warranty of authority.
B. Implied actual authority.
C. Ostensible authority.
D. Ratification by an undisclosed principal.

Answer: C
Explanation: Ostensible (or apparent) authority arises when a principal represents to a third party that an agent has authority, and the third party relies on this representation. By allowing the PA to regularly book rooms, the employer has represented to the hotel that she has authority to book accommodation. The hotel might reasonably believe this extends to this booking. It's not implied actual authority (which is authority the agent reasonably believes they have based on their position). Breach of warranty of authority is a claim against the agent, not a basis for principal liability. Ratification by undisclosed principal is contradictory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 13 [Learning Outcome 4.2]
An agent for a disclosed principal commits the tort of deceit by knowingly making false statements to a third party. Who, if anyone, is liable if the third party suffers a financial loss as a result of these statements?
A. No one.
B. The agent only.
C. The principal only.
D. Both the agent and the principal.

Answer: D
Explanation: For torts committed by an agent, both the agent and principal can be liable. The agent is personally liable for their own tortious acts (deceit is the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation). The principal is vicariously liable for torts committed by their agent acting within the scope of their authority. This encourages principals to supervise agents properly and ensures victims have recourse against both parties.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 14 [Learning Outcome 5.6]
Mia wishes to effect a life insurance policy on her husband's life and on her adult son's life. What is the maximum sum insured, if any, legally allowable under each policy?
A. An unlimited amount in respect of both policies.
B. An unlimited amount in respect of Mia's husband and a nominal amount in respect of her son.
C. An unlimited amount in respect of Mia's husband and she is not legally allowed to insure the life of her son.
D. Mia is not legally allowed to insure the life of either her husband or her son.

Answer: C
Explanation: Insurable interest in life insurance is unlimited between spouses – they have unlimited insurable interest in each other's lives based on their legal and financial relationship. However, parents do not have automatic insurable interest in their adult children's lives (adult children are not financial dependants). Whilst parents have insurable interest in young dependent children, once children reach adulthood and independence, the insurable interest ceases unless there's a specific financial relationship (like a business partnership or debt).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 15 [Learning Outcome 5.3]
When is insurable interest required in respect of a life insurance contract?
A. At both the time the contract is made and when a claim arises on death or maturity of the policy.
B. Only at the time the contract is made.
C. Only when a claim arises on death or maturity of the policy.
D. Throughout the duration of the contract.

Answer: B
Explanation: The Life Assurance Act 1774 requires insurable interest at inception of a life insurance contract. Once the contract is validly formed with insurable interest, it doesn't matter if that interest ceases during the policy term. This differs from indemnity insurance (property/liability) where insurable interest must exist at the time of loss. Life insurance is not a contract of indemnity – the sum insured is payable regardless of actual financial loss.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 16 [Learning Outcome 5.4]
During the period of insurance of a commercial policy, the policyholder acquires a subsidiary company for which cover is required under the policy. What specific legal duty of disclosure applies, if any, in respect of this additional risk at the date of acquisition?
A. The duty to make a fair representation of the additional risk.
B. The duty to take reasonable care not to misrepresent the additional risk.
C. None, as the acquisition is not a material fact.
D. None, as the duty of disclosure only applies at the renewal date.

Answer: A
Explanation: Under the Insurance Act 2015 (for non-consumer insurance), the duty to make a fair presentation applies at inception, renewal, and variation of risk. When a policyholder wants to add a subsidiary company to their policy, this constitutes a variation requiring fair presentation of that additional risk. The duty to take reasonable care not to misrepresent applies to consumer insurance under the Consumer Insurance Act 2012. The acquisition is material as it changes the risk profile. The duty applies at variation, not just renewal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 17 [Learning Outcome 5.5]
In consumer insurance law, a proposer for personal accident insurance is under a duty to
A. disclose all material facts relating to the contract.
B. make a fair representation of the risk.
C. take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation.
D. warrant that all answers on the proposal form are accurate.

Answer: C
Explanation: The Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012 replaced the common law duty of disclosure for consumer insurance with a duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation. The consumer must answer questions honestly and take reasonable care with their answers, but doesn't have a duty to volunteer information not asked about. 'Fair presentation' applies to commercial insurance under the Insurance Act 2015. Warranties are contractual terms with specific consequences for breach.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 18 [Learning Outcome 5.2]
The subject matter of an insurance policy CANNOT be
A. a future inheritance.
B. a loss of profits.
C. intangible property.
D. the life of another person.

Answer: A
Explanation: Insurable interest requires a legal or financial relationship with the subject matter. A future inheritance is a mere expectation (spes successionis) and cannot be insured – you have no legal right to inherit until the person dies and the will is executed. Loss of profits can be insured (business interruption insurance). Intangible property like intellectual property rights can be insured. You can insure another person's life if you have insurable interest in that life (e.g., spouse, business partner, creditor).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 19 [Learning Outcome 5.6]
The risk manager of a large construction company forgot to notify his property insurer that one of the contracts his company was accepting would involve hazardous work. In the event of a claim arising from this one contract, the insurer has the statutory legal remedy of
A. applying any different terms relating to hazardous work as if the insurance policy had contained these terms.
B. applying any different terms relating to hazardous work with effect from the date of the claim.
C. terminating the insurance policy from inception with no refund of premium.
D. terminating the insurance policy from the date of starting the hazardous work.

Answer: A
Explanation: Under the Insurance Act 2015, when an insured breaches the duty of fair presentation and the breach is neither deliberate nor reckless, the insurer's remedy depends on what they would have done if the true facts had been known. If they would have imposed different terms (like an exclusion for hazardous work), they can apply those terms retrospectively as if they'd been in the policy all along. This is called the 'proportionate remedy' regime. The terms apply from inception, not just from the date of the claim or breach.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 20 [Learning Outcome 6.2]
Special rules apply to employers' liability insurance in respect of the
A. applicability of basis of contract clauses.
B. avoidance of liability for breach of condition or warranty.
C. effect of a lack of insurable interest.
D. range of remedies following a misrepresentation.

Answer: B
Explanation: The Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Regulations provide special protection to employees. An insurer cannot refuse indemnity to injured employees on grounds of breach of warranty, condition, or non-disclosure by the employer. The insurer must pay the employee's claim and can then recover from the employer if the breach was serious. This protects innocent third parties (employees) from suffering due to their employer's failures. The other aspects of insurance law generally apply normally to EL insurance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 21 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
An example of a continuing warranty in an insurance contract is one that may require
A. an ongoing duty of disclosure throughout the period of a professional indemnity policy.
B. a quarterly declaration of shipments to enable the calculation of a marine cargo premium adjustment.
C. a security alarm system being operational whenever a property is unattended.
D. no admission of liability being made in the event of a gradual pollution claim.

Answer: C
Explanation: A continuing warranty is a term that must be continuously complied with throughout the policy period, not just at inception. An alarm warranty requiring the system to be operational when premises are unattended is a classic continuing warranty – it must be met every day. An ongoing duty of disclosure isn't typically a warranty (warranties relate to facts or states of affairs, not disclosure). Quarterly declarations are administrative requirements, not warranties about the state of the risk. Non-admission clauses are conditions precedent to liability, not warranties.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 22 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
In what type of contracts, if any, is the use of basis of contract clauses legally permitted?
A. In consumer insurance policies only.
B. In non-consumer insurance policies only.
C. In both consumer and non-consumer insurance policies.
D. In neither consumer nor non-consumer insurance policies.

Answer: D
Explanation: Basis of contract clauses (which convert all statements in a proposal form into warranties) are prohibited in both consumer and non-consumer insurance. The Consumer Insurance Act 2012 abolished them for consumer contracts. The Insurance Act 2015 abolished them for non-consumer contracts, requiring insurers to specifically bring warranty terms to the insured's attention. These clauses were considered unfair because they made even trivial inaccuracies grounds for avoiding the policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 23 [Learning Outcome 6.2]
What remedy is available to an insurer where a commercial policyholder has breached a collateral condition concerning a minor matter?
A. Avoid the policy ab initio.
B. Apply terms retrospectively.
C. Claim for damages.
D. Repudiate any future claim.

Answer: C
Explanation: Under the Insurance Act 2015, breach of a 'collateral' (non-suspensory) condition doesn't automatically entitle the insurer to refuse all claims. The remedy is damages for any loss caused by the breach. This reformed the harsh common law position where breach of any condition allowed repudiation. Suspensory conditions (conditions precedent to liability) do still allow claim refusal whilst breached, but only for claims connected to the breach. Avoidance ab initio is the remedy for misrepresentation, not breach of condition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 24 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, a contract term in an insurance policy will be considered unfair to the policyholder if it
A. causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations to the detriment of the policyholder.
B. defines a particularly narrow scope of cover in relation to the premium paid by the policyholder.
C. is a standard term that the policyholder does not have the opportunity to individually negotiate.
D. is ambiguous and one interpretation of the term is detrimental to the policyholder.

Answer: A
Explanation: The Consumer Rights Act 2015 requires contract terms to be fair. A term is unfair if, contrary to good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in rights and obligations to the consumer's detriment. Being a standard term doesn't make it unfair per se (most insurance terms are standard). The scope of cover isn't subject to fairness assessment (that's the core bargain). Ambiguous terms are interpreted contra proferentem (against the drafter) but aren't automatically unfair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 25 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
A broker, acting for a commercial policyholder, is reviewing a policy wording drawn up by an insurer. The broker proposes an additional clause for insertion into the policy, which the insurer agrees to incorporate. Which party to the contract will the clause be construed against in the event of ambiguity?
A. The broker and the insurer equally.
B. The broker and the policyholder equally.
C. The insurer only.
D. The policyholder only.

Answer: D
Explanation: The contra proferentem rule construes ambiguities against the party who drafted the term. When a broker (acting for the insured) proposes a clause, the broker is acting as the insured's agent, so the clause is treated as drafted by the policyholder, not the insurer. Therefore, ambiguities would be resolved against the policyholder. This is the opposite of standard policy terms drafted by insurers, which are construed against the insurer. The rule encourages clear drafting and protects the party who didn't draft the term.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 26 [Learning Outcome 6.2]
An insurance contract would automatically become void in the event of
A. bankruptcy of an agent.
B. breach of warranty.
C. illegality.
D. misrepresentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: A contract that is illegal (either at formation or due to illegal performance) is automatically void – neither party can enforce it. This is a fundamental principle of contract law. Breach of warranty under the Insurance Act 2015 suspends cover while the breach continues but doesn't void the contract. Misrepresentation makes the contract voidable (can be avoided by the innocent party) not automatically void. Bankruptcy of an agent terminates the agency but doesn't void the insurance contract itself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 27 [Learning Outcome 6.3]
A policyholder makes a claim for damage to his motor vehicle. After investigation, the insurer discovers the vehicle was being used by the policyholder in a criminal act. In these circumstances, the insurance policy is
A. valid and the claim will be paid.
B. valid but the claim will be rejected.
C. void.
D. voidable at the option of the insurer.

Answer: C
Explanation: When a contract is performed illegally (even if legally formed), it becomes void. Using an insured vehicle in the commission of a crime makes the contract illegal and void at the point of the illegal use. The insurer can reject the claim and potentially avoid the entire policy. This is a matter of public policy – insurance cannot be allowed to indemnify criminal conduct. The contract isn't merely voidable (giving the insurer a choice) – illegality automatically voids it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 28 [Learning Outcome 7.2]
The basis of the burden of proof that a named insured peril was the proximate cause of the loss falls upon the
A. policyholder to prove on the balance of probabilities.
B. policyholder to prove beyond reasonable doubt.
C. insurer to prove on the balance of probabilities.
D. insurer to prove beyond reasonable doubt.

Answer: A
Explanation: In insurance claims, the burden of proof lies with the claimant (policyholder) to prove: (1) a loss occurred, (2) it was caused by an insured peril, (3) the proximate cause was that insured peril. The standard of proof in civil cases is 'balance of probabilities' (more likely than not), not 'beyond reasonable doubt' (the criminal standard). If the policyholder proves prima facie cover, the insurer must prove any exclusion or exception they wish to rely on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 29 [Learning Outcome 7.4]
When two perils are described as interdependent, this means that they combine to cause a loss
A. and either peril would cause some loss without the other.
B. but neither peril can be an uninsured or an excepted peril.
C. but neither peril would cause loss on its own.
D. but only one peril is operating or imminent.

Answer: C
Explanation: Interdependent (or concurrent) causes operate together, and neither would cause the loss independently. For example, a ship sinks due to a combination of storm and inherent vice – neither alone would sink the ship. When interdependent causes include one insured and one excluded peril, the loss is generally not covered (the uninsured peril can't be separated out). This differs from independent concurrent causes where each could cause loss alone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 30 [Learning Outcome 7.4]
What is the effect of a clause in an insurance contract that excludes losses directly or indirectly caused by flooding?
A. Flooding cover cannot be provided by a separate buy-back policy.
B. Flooding is an uninsured peril in relation to concurrent causes.
C. Flooding must be the proximate cause of the loss in order for the exclusion to operate.
D. Flooding need only be a remote cause of the loss in order for the exclusion to operate.

Answer: D
Explanation: Exclusion clauses specifying "directly or indirectly" are wider than standard exclusions. Standard exclusions apply only when the excluded peril is the proximate cause. "Directly or indirectly" clauses exclude the peril even when it's a remote cause in the chain of causation. This makes the exclusion very broad – if flooding is anywhere in the causal chain, even as a remote cause, the loss is excluded. Such clauses can be bought back through separate endorsements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 31 [Learning Outcome 7.2]
A policy condition requiring the policyholder to give notice of a loss and also any incident or event which may give rise to a claim, is most relevant in an insurance policy covering
A. personal accident.
B. professional liabilities.
C. property damage.
D. travel risks.

Answer: B
Explanation: Professional indemnity and liability policies typically operate on a 'claims made' or 'claims made and notified' basis. Policyholders must notify not just actual claims but also circumstances that might give rise to claims. This is because liability claims often arise long after the negligent act (e.g., a design flaw discovered years later). Early notification allows insurers to investigate and potentially mitigate losses. Property and personal accident policies operate on a 'losses occurring' basis with simpler notification requirements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 32 [Learning Outcome 7.1]
What statute permits the third party victim of a motor accident to make a direct claim against the motor insurer of the negligent driver who caused the accident?
A. The Consumer Protection Act 1987.
B. The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
C. The Road Traffic Act 1988.
D. The Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 2010.

Answer: C
Explanation: Section 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 gives injured third parties the right to proceed directly against the negligent driver's insurer once they've obtained judgment against the driver. This overcomes the privity of contract problem (the injured party isn't party to the insurance contract). The Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Acts 2010 and 1930 deal with insolvent defendants. The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 gives third party beneficiaries contract rights in certain circumstances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 33 [Learning Outcome 7.1]
If a policyholder wishes to take out a life insurance policy insuring their own life expressly for the benefit of a third party, they can arrange this legally by
A. appointing the third party as sole executor to their will.
B. establishing a trust for the third party.
C. naming the third party on the policy as an additional insured.
D. noting the interest of the third party on the policy as bailee.

Answer: B
Explanation: A trust can be created to hold life insurance proceeds for the benefit of a third party. The Married Women's Property Act 1882 specifically facilitates this for spouses and children. The policyholder (as settlor) creates a trust, naming the third party as beneficiary. The trust overcomes the privity of contract doctrine. Appointing someone as executor gives them power to administer the estate, not beneficial ownership. Third parties cannot be 'additional insureds' on their own lives. Bailment is a property law concept irrelevant to life insurance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 34 [Learning Outcome 8.3]
A fire destroys a business premises and the policyholder receives payment of the full sum insured from his property insurer. If the new premises are rebuilt on the same site during the current policy period, insurance for the premises will be arranged under
A. a new policy at new terms.
B. an endorsement to the existing policy for an additional premium.
C. the existing policy subject to a reinstatement premium.
D. the existing policy at no additional premium.

Answer: A
Explanation: Once a property is totally destroyed and the full sum insured is paid, the insurance contract is exhausted and terminates. If new premises are built on the same site, this is a new risk requiring a new insurance contract on new terms reflecting the current value and risk profile. This differs from partial losses where the policy continues. Some policies have reinstatement clauses allowing automatic reinstatement of the sum insured on payment of additional premium, but this still relates to the same building, not a new one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 35 [Learning Outcome 8.2]
Which insurance policy can make a deduction for betterment?
A. An agreed value policy for a vintage car.
B. A new for old household contents insurance policy.
C. A personal accident insurance policy.
D. A property insurance policy for business machinery.

Answer: D
Explanation: Betterment occurs when repairs or replacement put the insured in a better position than before the loss (e.g., old machinery replaced with new). Insurers can deduct for betterment to preserve the indemnity principle – the insured shouldn't profit from the loss. Business property policies commonly apply betterment deductions. Agreed value policies pay the agreed sum regardless of actual value. 'New for old' policies deliberately provide betterment (that's their purpose). Personal accident policies are valued policies paying fixed sums for injuries, not subject to betterment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 36 [Learning Outcome 8.3]
Which insurance principle is supported by the following formula to calculate the liability of the insurer?
Sum insured at the time of loss x amount of loss / Value at risk at the time of loss
A. Contribution using the independent liability method.
B. The Elcock principle for partial losses under an agreed value policy.
C. The pro rata condition of average.
D. Subrogation where the recovery from the third party is less than the loss.

Answer: C
Explanation: This is the standard pro rata average formula applied when a property is underinsured. If the sum insured is less than the value at risk, the insurer's liability is reduced proportionately. For example, if property worth £100,000 is insured for only £50,000 (50% of value), a £20,000 loss would be paid as: (£50,000/£100,000) × £20,000 = £10,000. This encourages adequate insurance and prevents insureds from deliberately underinsuring to pay lower premiums.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 37 [Learning Outcome 9.3]
It is usual for an insurer to insert a subrogation waiver clause into a contract to agree with a policyholder that the insurer will NOT exercise subrogation rights against
A. other insurers.
B. reinsurers.
C. subsidiary companies of the policyholder.
D. any third parties.

Answer: C
Explanation: Subrogation waivers commonly prevent insurers from pursuing subsidiaries, associated companies, or group companies of the insured. Without a waiver, an insurer paying a parent company's claim could pursue the negligent subsidiary – money would move within the group but generate legal costs. Waivers prevent this inefficiency. Insurers wouldn't generally waive rights against all third parties (that would undermine subrogation's purpose). Subrogation against other insurers relates to contribution (a different principle). Reinsurance is a separate contract.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 38 [Learning Outcome 9.6]
A policyholder's motor vehicle has suffered damage caused by a negligent third party. The damage cost £900 to repair with the insurer making payment of £800 after deduction of the £100 policy excess. The insurer recovered £500 from the negligent motorist. How will this £500 recovery be distributed?
A. The policyholder is entitled to £100 and the insurer £400.
B. The policyholder is entitled to £200 and the insurer £300.
C. The policyholder is entitled to the full £500.
D. The insurer is entitled to the full £500.

Answer: D
Explanation: When an insurer has paid the full claim (less any excess), they are entitled to recoveries from third parties up to the amount they paid. The £100 excess represents the policyholder's uninsured loss. If recovery exceeds the insurer's payment (£800), the surplus goes to the policyholder to cover their excess. Here, the £500 recovery is less than the £800 paid by the insurer, so the insurer keeps all of it. The policyholder bears the £100 excess and the remaining £400 shortfall.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 39 [Learning Outcome 9.5]
The maximum liability method of calculating contribution operates, but with unfair results, if only one of the relevant policies
A. has additional named insureds.
B. includes a subrogation clause.
C. is a policy of indemnity.
D. is subject to a policy excess.

Answer: D
Explanation: The maximum liability method calculates each insurer's contribution based on the ratio of their maximum liability to the total of all insurers' maximum liabilities. If one policy has an excess, its maximum liability for the particular loss is reduced, but the method doesn't account for this fairly. The insurer with the excess would pay a disproportionately small share. The independent liability method handles this better by calculating what each insurer would pay independently, then apportioning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 40 [Learning Outcome 9.5]
Two property insurance policies cover the same loss but the policy terms and conditions differ. Following a claim, which method of calculating contribution is most likely to be used?
A. The average method.
B. The independent liability method.
C. The maximum liability method.
D. The reinstatement method.

Answer: B
Explanation: When policies have different terms and conditions (different excesses, conditions, exclusions, or limits), the independent liability method is most appropriate. This method calculates what each insurer would pay if they were the only insurer, then apportions liability based on those amounts. This accounts for differences in policy terms. The maximum liability method assumes similar policies. The average method is rarely used. Reinstatement is a method of providing indemnity, not calculating contribution.

MULTIPLE RESPONSE QUESTIONS (Q41-Q50)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 41 [Learning Outcome 1.6]
A persuasive precedent may be set by (Select all that apply)
A. a decision made in the lower courts.
B. a decision made by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
C. a local custom.
D. obiter dicta of senior judges in a high-level decision.
E. the ratio decidendi of a previous case with similar issues.

Answer: A, B, D
Explanation: Persuasive precedents are not binding but may influence judicial decisions. Lower court decisions can persuade but don't bind higher courts. The Privy Council's decisions are persuasive (not binding) in UK courts. Obiter dicta (judicial comments 'by the way') from senior judges can be highly persuasive. However, ratio decidendi (the legal principle necessary for the decision) from a binding precedent creates a binding, not merely persuasive, precedent. Local customs can influence law but aren't typically classified as persuasive precedents in the formal sense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 42 [Learning Outcome 1.3]
What roles are typically carried out by solicitors in England and Wales? (Select all that apply)
A. Drawing up contracts for the sale or purchase of property.
B. Providing a specialist advocacy service in the higher courts.
C. Giving opinions on complex or niche areas of law.
D. Offering professional advice on matters of family law.
E. Representing corporate clients in the lower courts.

Answer: A, D, E
Explanation: Solicitors traditionally handle conveyancing (property transactions), provide legal advice across various areas including family law, and represent clients in lower courts. Whilst some solicitors have higher court advocacy rights, specialist advocacy in higher courts is traditionally the domain of barristers. Similarly, whilst solicitors may advise on complex matters, barristers are traditionally consulted for specialist opinions on niche or complex legal questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 43 [Learning Outcome 2.1]
Which torts are actionable per se? (Select all that apply)
A. Assault.
B. False imprisonment.
C. Negligent misstatement.
D. Private nuisance.
E. Trespass to land.

Answer: A, B, E
Explanation: Torts actionable per se do not require proof of damage – the wrong itself is sufficient. Assault, battery, false imprisonment, and trespass (to land, goods, or person) are all actionable per se. Negligent misstatement requires proof of damage (usually financial loss). Private nuisance generally requires proof of damage to use or enjoyment of land, though there are limited exceptions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 44 [Learning Outcome 3.1]
An employers' liability insurance policy can be classified as being a type of (Select all that apply)
A. bilateral contract.
B. collateral contract.
C. contract under seal.
D. simple contract.
E. unilateral contract.

Answer: A, D
Explanation: An insurance policy is a bilateral contract (both parties exchange promises: the insurer promises to pay claims, the insured promises to pay premiums) and a simple contract (not requiring a deed, though supported by consideration). It is not unilateral (where only one party makes a promise, like a reward offer). It is not collateral (a side agreement to a main contract). Insurance contracts are not typically contracts under seal (deeds), though they historically were.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 45 [Learning Outcome 4.2]
When may an agent be legally allowed to delegate contractual duties to a sub-agent without the express permission of the principal? (Select all that apply)
A. In accordance with trade custom.
B. Only if the sub-agent is based overseas.
C. Out of necessity.
D. Whenever it is cheaper to do so.

Answer: A, C
Explanation: The general rule is delegatus non potest delegare (a delegate cannot delegate). However, delegation is permitted in certain circumstances: (1) with the principal's express or implied consent, (2) where trade custom permits it, (3) out of necessity (when unavoidable and reasonable), and (4) for purely ministerial acts (not requiring discretion). The location of the sub-agent is irrelevant. Cost savings don't justify delegation without permission.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 46 [Learning Outcome 5.5]
What statutory remedy is available to an insurer where a qualifying misrepresentation, which is careless, has been made by a consumer policyholder? (Select all that apply)
A. Amend the contract terms from those originally agreed.
B. Avoid the contract and keep any premium paid.
C. Maintain the contract but avoid any claims relating to the misrepresentation.
D. Proportionately reduce the amount to be paid on a claim if a higher premium would have been charged.

Answer: A, D
Explanation: Under the Consumer Insurance Act 2012, remedies for careless misrepresentation depend on what the insurer would have done if the true facts had been known: (1) If they would have charged a higher premium: reduce claims proportionately based on premium actually paid vs. premium that would have been charged. (2) If they would have imposed different terms: apply those terms as if they'd been in the contract. Avoidance is only available for deliberate/reckless misrepresentation. There's no remedy of avoiding particular claims whilst maintaining the contract.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 47 [Learning Outcome 5.2]
A key element of insurable interest is that in relation to the subject matter of the insurance, the policyholder must have (Select all that apply)
A. a current interest.
B. an expectation of acquiring an interest.
C. a financial interest.
D. a legal interest.
E. the sole interest.

Answer: A, C, D
Explanation: Insurable interest requires: (1) a current interest (not merely expected future interest), (2) a legal or equitable interest (not just moral or emotional), (3) a financial interest (you would suffer financial loss if the insured event occurred). The interest need not be sole – multiple parties can have insurable interests in the same subject matter (hence co-insurance and double insurance situations). Mere expectation of acquiring interest (like hoping to inherit) doesn't create insurable interest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 48 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
Which rules apply to deal with issues regarding inconsistencies or contradictions in policy wordings? (Select all that apply)
A. An express term overrules or modifies any implied term.
B. An implied term overrules or modifies any express term.
C. Handwritten endorsements take priority over printed words in a policy document.
D. A policy document takes priority over a proposal form.

Answer: A, C, D
Explanation: When policy terms conflict, courts apply construction rules: (1) Express terms prevail over implied terms (parties' explicit agreement trumps implications). (2) Handwritten or typed additions prevail over pre-printed terms (later, specific modifications trump standard wording). (3) Policy documents prevail over proposal forms (the final contract trumps preliminary negotiations). These rules help determine the parties' true intentions when documents contradict each other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 49 [Learning Outcome 8.3]
Which items are most commonly insured on an agreed value basis? (Select all that apply)
A. Antiques.
B. Golf clubs.
C. Household appliances.
D. Ships.
E. Works of art.

Answer: A, D, E
Explanation: Agreed value policies are used for items where market value is difficult to establish or might fluctuate significantly: antiques, works of art, classic cars, ships, and rare collections. An agreed valuation is established at inception and paid in the event of total loss, avoiding disputes about value. Golf clubs and household appliances have readily ascertainable market values and are typically insured on an indemnity basis (actual value at time of loss).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 50 [Learning Outcome 9.1]
The operation of the principle of subrogation, and the way in which any recovery from a third party is shared between the policyholder and the insurers, depends on (Select all that apply)
A. the amount of the recovery in relation to the loss.
B. the time when subrogation rights arise.
C. whether the insurance covers the loss in full.
D. whether there is a non contribution clause.

Answer: A, C
Explanation: Distribution of subrogation recoveries depends on: (1) Whether the insurance covered the loss in full – if the insured bore part of the loss (through underinsurance or excess), they share in recoveries proportionately. (2) The amount recovered relative to the loss – if recovery exceeds the insurer's payment, surplus goes to the insured. The timing of when rights arise doesn't affect distribution. Non-contribution clauses relate to contribution between insurers, not subrogation recoveries from third parties.

Question 1 [Learning Outcome 1.4]
The final court of appeal for some commonwealth countries is the
A. Crown Court.
B. High Court.
C. Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
D. Supreme Court.

Answer: C
Explanation: The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council serves as the final court of appeal for certain Commonwealth countries, British Overseas Territories, and Crown Dependencies. The UK Supreme Court is the highest court for UK cases. The Crown Court is a criminal trial court, and the High Court is a first-instance civil court for more complex matters.

Question 2 [Learning Outcome 1.2]
The Marine Insurance Act 1906 is an example of
A. a codifying act.
B. delegated legislation.
C. international legislation.
D. a retrospective act.

Answer: A
Explanation: A codifying act consolidates existing common law principles into statutory form. The Marine Insurance Act 1906 codified centuries of case law and custom in marine insurance. Delegated legislation is secondary legislation made under powers granted by an Act of Parliament. International legislation would be treaties or conventions, and retrospective acts apply to past events, which is generally avoided.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3 [Learning Outcome 1.5]
A 'litigation friend' ('next friend') is responsible for litigation costs awarded against a claimant who is a
A. bankrupt.
B. company.
C. partnership.
D. minor.

Answer: D
Explanation: A litigation friend (formerly called 'next friend' for claimants or 'guardian ad litem' for defendants) represents parties who lack capacity to conduct legal proceedings themselves, most commonly minors (those under 18). The litigation friend takes responsibility for the conduct of the case and any costs awarded against their charge. Bankrupts retain capacity to litigate, whilst companies and partnerships can litigate in their own right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4 [Learning Outcome 2.2]
The rule in Rylands v Fletcher may apply when there is
A. a defamatory statement.
B. fault or negligence by the defendant.
C. a negligent misstatement.
D. an escape of a dangerous thing from the defendant's land.

Answer: D
Explanation: Rylands v Fletcher establishes strict liability when someone brings onto their land something likely to cause mischief if it escapes, and it does escape causing damage. No fault or negligence need be proved – it's a form of strict liability. Defamation and negligent misstatement are entirely separate torts with different requirements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5 [Learning Outcome 2.2]
For which tort is the claimant never required to prove that he has suffered loss or damage?
A. Negligence.
B. Nuisance.
C. Slander.
D. Trespass.

Answer: D
Explanation: Trespass (to land, person, or goods) is actionable per se, meaning the claimant need not prove damage – the interference with rights is itself sufficient. Negligence always requires proof of damage. Nuisance usually requires proof of damage (though some public nuisances may be actionable per se). Slander (spoken defamation) generally requires proof of special damage, unlike libel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 6 [Learning Outcome 2.5]
Katy's mother bought her an iron, which turned out to be defective and caused a fire. It resulted in damage to Katy's personal property amounting to £500 and also caused severe burns to Katy's right hand. In order to achieve a recovery at law, which legal action should be pursued?
A. Katy's mother should sue the seller in tort based on the principle of negligence.
B. Katy should sue her mother based on the principle of vicarious liability.
C. Katy should sue the manufacturer based on the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1987.
D. Katy should sue the seller for breach of contract in selling a defective electrical product.

Answer: C
Explanation: The Consumer Protection Act 1987 provides strict liability for defective products, allowing anyone injured by a defective product to sue the manufacturer directly without proving negligence. Katy has suffered both personal injury and property damage. The contract is between Katy's mother and the seller, so Katy cannot sue in contract (lack of privity). Her mother could sue the seller in contract, but this wouldn't help Katy directly. The CPA 1987 route provides Katy the most direct claim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 7 [Learning Outcome 3.4]
An insurance policy would be illegal and void if it is
A. an employer's liability policy for a company without any employees.
B. a household contents policy insuring a gun collection.
C. a products liability policy covering fines for health and safety breaches.
D. a marine cargo policy taken out by a person who is not the owner of the cargo.

Answer: C
Explanation: Contracts are illegal and void if they involve illegal conduct or are contrary to public policy. Insurance policies that cover criminal fines or penalties are void as contrary to public policy – allowing such insurance would undermine the deterrent effect of penalties. An EL policy without employees is pointless but not illegal. Insuring gun collections is legal (guns can be legally owned). Marine cargo insurance doesn't require ownership – insurable interest can arise from other relationships with the goods.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 8 [Learning Outcome 3.2]
With regard to formation of a contract, consideration must always be a
A. benefit to the person receiving it or a detriment to the person giving it.
B. detriment to the person receiving it or a benefit to the person giving it.
C. benefit to both the person giving it and the person receiving it.
D. detriment to both the person giving it and the person receiving it.

Answer: A
Explanation: Consideration in contract law can be satisfied in two ways: either the promisee must suffer a detriment (give up something of value) or the promisor must receive a benefit. The classic definition is that consideration must be 'something of value in the eyes of the law' moving from the promisee. It need not be adequate (equal in value) but must be sufficient (having some value).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 9 [Learning Outcome 3.3]
Adam had a contract with a specialist storage company to store some valuable paintings, but damp storage conditions resulted in damage to the paintings. Although Adam's contract did NOT expressly state the storage requirements had to be suitable, he successfully sued the storage company on the basis that the contract terms were implied
A. by custom.
B. by promissory estoppel.
C. in equity.
D. in law.

Answer: D
Explanation: Terms can be implied into contracts in three ways: (1) by statute (in law), (2) by custom in a particular trade, or (3) by the courts to give 'business efficacy' or based on the presumed intention of parties (in fact). For a storage contract, there's an implied term that the storage will be suitable for the purpose – this is implied by common law (in law) based on the nature of the service contract. Promissory estoppel is a different doctrine that prevents parties from going back on promises.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 10 [Learning Outcome 3.4]
A life insurance policy would automatically be void for illegality if
A. the insured committed suicide after inception.
B. there is no insurable interest at inception.
C. the premium had not been paid at inception.
D. the insurer became insolvent after inception.

Answer: B
Explanation: Under the Life Assurance Act 1774, a life insurance contract without insurable interest at inception is void for illegality (being essentially a wager). This is a fundamental requirement. Suicide after inception doesn't make the contract illegal (though claims may be excluded by policy terms). Non-payment of premium is a contractual breach, not illegality. Insurer insolvency is a business failure, not illegality affecting the contract's formation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 11 [Learning Outcome 4.2]
An insurance broker grants cover for motor insurance to a 21-year-old proposer. However, the broker's authority is restricted to only granting cover to drivers aged 23 years and over. What basis, if at all, is the insurer bound to cover the 21-year-old?
A. Agency by estoppel.
B. Apparent authority.
C. Implied actual authority.
D. The insurer is not bound.

Answer: B
Explanation: Apparent (or ostensible) authority exists when a principal represents to third parties that an agent has authority, regardless of actual restrictions. If the insurer holds out the broker as having authority to grant motor insurance without communicating the age restriction to proposers, the broker has apparent authority to bind the insurer. The proposer doesn't know about the restriction and reasonably believes the broker can grant cover. The insurer is bound but can take action against the broker for exceeding actual authority.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 12 [Learning Outcome 4.4]
Whilst Tim was on holiday, unknown to him his agent made a contract on his behalf. Tim is happy to ratify the contract but he does want to change a minor term. The services under the contract are scheduled to be carried out next week. What is the legal position regarding ratification of the contract?
A. Tim cannot ratify the contract as it was made without his knowledge.
B. Tim cannot ratify the contract excluding the minor term as the whole contract must be ratified.
C. Tim can ratify the contract and change the term as it is only a minor term.
D. Tim can ratify the contract and change the minor term if this is done within reasonable time.

Answer: B
Explanation: Ratification is when a principal adopts a contract made by an agent without authority. Key rules of ratification include: (1) the principal must have been in existence and identified when the contract was made, (2) the principal must have capacity, (3) ratification must be of the entire contract (can't pick and choose terms), (4) ratification must occur within a reasonable time, and (5) the principal must have full knowledge of the material circumstances. Tim cannot ratify part of the contract – it's all or nothing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 13 [Learning Outcome 4.2]
Alice acted as an agent for Ted in a house clearance sale and has successfully claimed commission by implied agreement. What does this indicate about the commission?
A. It was agreed as it was based on a verbal agreement.
B. It was agreed as it was detailed in an agency contract.
C. It was not agreed, but Alice had a lien on Ted's property.
D. It was not agreed, but Alice's work was in her usual line of business for which she would normally be paid.

Answer: D
Explanation: An agent's right to remuneration can arise by: (1) express agreement, (2) implied agreement, (3) custom of the trade, or (4) statute. An implied agreement arises when the circumstances indicate the parties intended payment, even without explicit agreement. If Alice operates a professional house clearance business (not just helping a friend), the court will imply a term that she should be paid a reasonable fee – it's understood that professionals expect payment. A lien protects the right to payment but doesn't create the right itself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 14 [Learning Outcome 5.4]
In respect of consumer insurance contracts, the duty of utmost good faith means that the
A. broker has a duty to the proposer to find the widest coverage at the best price.
B. broker and the insurer have a duty of confidentiality regarding contract information.
C. proposer has a duty to disclose all material facts relating to the contract.
D. proposer and the insurer have a duty to deal honestly and openly in negotiations leading to formation of the contract.

Answer: D
Explanation: Utmost good faith (uberrimae fidei) is a mutual duty applying to both parties to act honestly and openly in their dealings. Since the Consumer Insurance Act 2012, the consumer's specific disclosure duty has been replaced with the duty to take reasonable care not to misrepresent, but the broader duty of good faith remains on both parties. The insurer must not take advantage of the consumer's lack of knowledge. Broker duties are separate agency duties. Confidentiality is a different legal concept.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 15 [Learning Outcome 5.3]
Stuart has a joint mortgage with his wife of £60,000 and a personal loan of £5,000, but no other debts. How much insurable interest does his wife have in his life?
A. A maximum of £30,000.
B. A maximum of £60,000.
C. A maximum of £65,000.
D. An unlimited amount.

Answer: D
Explanation: Spouses have unlimited insurable interest in each other's lives. This reflects their legal and financial interdependence and mutual expectation of support. The amount of specific debts is irrelevant – the insurable interest isn't limited to quantifiable financial obligations. This differs from insuring other people's lives (like business partners) where interest is usually limited to the financial relationship.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 16 [Learning Outcome 5.4]
A proposer for property insurance did NOT inform the insurer that his business premises were protected by a burglar alarm. What are the implications, if any, of this omission once the insurer is on risk and the premium is paid?
A. None, as it is a factor that lessens the risk.
B. The insurer is obliged to refund a proportion of the premium.
C. The insurer can avoid the policy for non-disclosure.
D. The insurer is obliged to quote revised premium terms to the proposer.

Answer: A
Explanation: Factors that reduce or lessen the risk need not be disclosed – there's no duty to disclose these. The burglar alarm makes the risk better (less likely to be burgled), not worse. The duty of disclosure concerns facts that would influence the insurer's assessment of the risk in accepting it and setting terms. Good features that make the risk more attractive don't need to be disclosed, though the proposer might mention them to get a better premium.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 17 [Learning Outcome 5.6]
When applying for a household contents insurance policy, the proposer deliberately provided the insurer with misleading information and so the insurer avoided the policy. In what circumstances, if any, is the insurer obliged to return the premium to the policyholder?
A. There is no obligation to return the premium.
B. The premium exceeds a de minimis amount.
C. It was an online application and premium payment.
D. Retaining the premium would be unfair to the policyholder.

Answer: D
Explanation: Under the Consumer Insurance Act 2012, when an insurer avoids a consumer policy for deliberate or reckless misrepresentation, they may refuse all claims AND need not return premiums paid UNLESS retaining the premium would be unfair. This gives courts discretion to order premium return if retention would be disproportionate or unjust in the circumstances. The test is fairness, not the amount, method of payment, or any automatic rule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 18 [Learning Outcome 5.3]
Under English Law, the right to insure the life of another person arises if there is
A. the authority of the Law Commission.
B. the consent of the life assured.
C. a financial relationship recognised at law.
D. a relationship characterised by a close bond of natural affection.

Answer: C
Explanation: Insurable interest in another person's life requires a legal or financial relationship recognised in law. This includes: spouses, creditor/debtor relationships, business partnerships, employer/key employee, and parent/dependent child. Mere affection or friendship is insufficient. Consent of the life assured is not the test for insurable interest (though it may be required for other reasons, like data protection). The Law Commission studies law reform but doesn't grant rights to insure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 19 [Learning Outcome 5.4]
The Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012 abolished the duty of disclosure in consumer insurance and replaced it with the duty to take reasonable care NOT to make a
A. fraudulent statement.
B. misrepresentation.
C. qualifying disclosure.
D. representation.

Answer: B
Explanation: The Consumer Insurance Act 2012 replaced the common law duty to disclose material facts with a duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation. A misrepresentation is a false statement of fact. The Act focuses on what the consumer actually says (or writes), not what they fail to volunteer. Consumers must answer questions honestly and carefully but need not disclose unrequested information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 20 [Learning Outcome 5.4]
To what extent, if at all, does the duty of good faith apply to employers' liability insurance?
A. It applies in exactly the same way as it does to all other non-consumer insurances.
B. It does not apply as it is a compulsory class of insurance.
C. It only applies at inception of the policy but is not revived at renewal.
D. It only applies to large companies, defined as those with more than 50 employees.

Answer: A
Explanation: Employers' Liability insurance, despite being compulsory under the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, is subject to the same duty of fair presentation under the Insurance Act 2015 as other non-consumer insurance. The fact that the insurance is compulsory doesn't exempt the insured from disclosure duties. However, special rules do apply to EL insurance regarding remedies – insurers cannot avoid the policy or refuse indemnity to employees injured by breaches of warranty or non-disclosure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 21 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
Under English law, an element of statutory control over the wording of consumer insurance policies is imposed by the
A. Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012.
B. Consumer Protection Act 1987.
C. Consumer Rights Act 2015.
D. Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.

Answer: C
Explanation: The Consumer Rights Act 2015 controls the fairness of contract terms in consumer contracts, including insurance. Terms must be transparent, prominent, and fair. Unfair terms are not binding on consumers. The Consumer Insurance Act 2012 deals with misrepresentation and disclosure, not general contract terms. The Consumer Protection Act 1987 concerns product liability. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 was largely superseded for consumer contracts by the 2015 Act.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 22 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
The contractual term stating that a life insurance policy will NOT come into effect until the premium is paid is an example of
A. a condition precedent to contract.
B. a condition precedent to liability.
C. a continuous warranty.
D. an implied warranty.

Answer: A
Explanation: A condition precedent to contract is something that must occur before the contract comes into existence. Payment of the first premium is typically a condition precedent to the insurance contract becoming effective – until payment, there's no contract. This differs from a condition precedent to liability (which suspends the insurer's obligation to pay claims whilst breached). A warranty is a promise about facts or states of affairs. This payment requirement is express, not implied.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 23 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
Why may an insurer insert a continuing warranty into an insurance policy?
A. To avoid paying a loss if it is caused by a peril stated in the policy.
B. To enable an insurer to charge an additional premium if the warranty is breached.
C. To ensure that a full sum insured is declared to avoid underinsurance.
D. To ensure that measures are taken to improve risk management.

Answer: D
Explanation: Continuing warranties require ongoing compliance with risk management measures (like maintaining fire extinguishers, keeping a watchman, using approved locks). They incentivise policyholders to maintain risk improvements throughout the policy period. Breaching a warranty doesn't trigger additional premium – under the Insurance Act 2015, cover is suspended during the breach. Exclusions (not warranties) prevent claims for specified perils. Sum insured adequacy is addressed through average clauses, not warranties.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 24 [Learning Outcome 6.2]
When an insured breaches a suspensive condition, for how long, if at all, is policy cover invalid?
A. It is never invalid, but the insurer is entitled to damages.
B. It is valid on condition that the insured describes the risk in reasonable time.
C. It is invalid only for the period that the insured continues to breach the condition.
D. It is invalid immediately and the policy is terminated from the date of the breach of the condition.

Answer: C
Explanation: Under the Insurance Act 2015, a suspensory condition (or warranty) suspends the insurer's liability for the period during which the insured is in breach. Once the breach is remedied, cover automatically reinstates from that point forward. The policy is not terminated, and the insurer remains liable for losses occurring before the breach and after remedy. This reformed the harsh common law position where breach of warranty permanently discharged the insurer from all future liability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 25 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
Two policies were incepted and both were in joint names. Policy X was arranged by a lessor and lessee and policy Y was taken out by a married couple who have an equal share in their home. What are the likely types of policy X and policy Y?
A. Policy X is a composite policy and policy Y is a joint policy.
B. Policy X is a joint policy and policy Y is a composite policy.
C. Both policy X and policy Y are composite.
D. Both policy X and policy Y are joint.

Answer: A
Explanation: A composite policy insures multiple parties with distinct interests (like lessor and lessee who have different legal interests in the property). Each party is separately insured under the same policy. A joint policy insures parties with a common, undivided interest (like spouses jointly owning a home with equal shares). This distinction affects how claims are handled and how contribution operates between insurers if double insurance exists.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 26 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
A clause in a company's professional indemnity policy enables the insurer to avoid paying for any losses when an insured admits responsibility for the loss. This type of clause is
A. a condition precedent to contract.
B. a condition precedent to liability.
C. an express warranty.
D. an implied warranty.

Answer: B
Explanation: A condition precedent to liability (or 'claims condition') specifies something the insured must do (or refrain from doing) as a prerequisite to the insurer's obligation to pay claims. Non-admission of liability clauses prevent the insured from admitting fault without insurer consent. If breached, the insurer can refuse to indemnify that claim. It's not a condition precedent to contract (which determines if the contract forms). It's not a warranty (which relates to the state of risk, not claims procedures).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 27 [Learning Outcome 6.3]
A warranty in a household buildings insurance policy states that the chimney of the property should be professionally swept every year prior to winter use. A loss occurs as a result of severe winds and the chimney is damaged. How is the insurer legally entitled to respond to the claim for property damage to the chimney if the insured has breached the warranty?
A. Avoid the claim but keep the policy in force.
B. Reduce the claim payment pro rata.
C. Reject the claim and terminate the policy.
D. Settle the claim in full.

Answer: D
Explanation: Under the Insurance Act 2015, when a warranty is breached, the insurer is not liable for losses occurring during the breach, but ONLY if the loss is connected to the breach. Wind damage to the chimney has no causal connection to whether it was swept (sweeping prevents fire risk, not wind damage). The insurer must pay the claim in full. The policy continues – warranty breach suspends cover during the breach but doesn't terminate the policy or allow avoidance.

Question 28 [Learning Outcome 7.6]
A policyholder has a fire insurance policy which excludes storm and other perils. A fire broke out due to faulty machinery overheating. At the same time as the fire, a violent storm blew the roof off the buildings and caused a power cut so that the fire alarm did NOT operate which led to a more serious fire than would have occurred otherwise. For what damage, if any, would the fire insurers be liable?
A. The fire damage only.
B. The fire damage only less a reduction for the fire alarm being non-operational.
C. The fire damage and the storm damage as they are concurrent causes.
D. No damage.

Answer: A
Explanation: The proximate cause of the damage must be identified. The fire was the dominant and effective cause of the damage – it started independently of the storm. The storm made the fire worse (by knocking out power and the alarm), but fire remains the proximate cause. Storm damage is excluded, but fire damage is covered. The insurer is liable for all damage proximately caused by fire, even though the storm contributed to making it worse. This applies the principle from Wayne Tank.

Question 29 [Learning Outcome 7.1]
Joe has been injured in a motor accident. Under section 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, he has the right to make a direct claim against the insurer of the negligent driver, Sally, if he
A. is a minor and has no contractual capacity.
B. has an unsatisfied court judgment against Sally.
C. has already had a claim against the Motor Insurers' Bureau rejected.
D. was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident and no contributory negligence applies.

Answer: B
Explanation: Section 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 gives injured third parties the right to proceed directly against the negligent driver's insurer once they've obtained judgment against the driver and that judgment remains unsatisfied (unpaid). This overcomes the privity of contract problem. The claimant must first sue the driver and get judgment. Age, contributory negligence, and MIB claims are irrelevant to this statutory right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 30 [Learning Outcome 7.4]
If an insurance claim is disputed and causation is an issue, what approach will a court take when looking to identify the proximate cause of the loss?
A. It will accept the decision of the jury as guided on points of law by the judge.
B. It will follow decisions made by international courts.
C. It will rely on the common understanding of causation by a layperson.
D. It will require proof of causation by scientific and/or technical means.

Answer: C
Explanation: Proximate cause is determined by applying common sense and business understanding, not scientific tests. The test is: what would a reasonable person, with knowledge of all the facts, identify as the dominant or effective cause? This is the principle from Leyland Shipping. Courts don't use purely scientific causation (causa causans). Juries are rare in civil insurance cases. International courts have no jurisdiction over English insurance contracts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 31 [Learning Outcome 7.4]
Dan's insurer identified fire as the proximate cause of his insurance claim although the loss resulted from a series of perils. This indicates the insurer has judged that the fire must be the
A. only insured peril.
B. most dominant of the perils.
C. first of the series of perils.
D. last of the series of perils.

Answer: B
Explanation: When multiple perils operate in sequence, the proximate cause is the dominant, effective, or real cause – not necessarily the first or last in time. The test asks: what set the chain in motion in an effective way? Fire being identified as the proximate cause means it was the most dominant or operative cause, even if other perils preceded or followed it. This applies the principle from Leyland Shipping v Norwich Union.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 32 [Learning Outcome 7.6]
Ian's speedboat suffered damage during a storm. The insurer identified that a design fault on the boat was a second and concurrent cause of the damage. Neither the storm nor the design fault would have caused the loss on its own. Ian's marine insurance policy provided cover against storm damage but the design fault was an uninsured peril. How, if at all, would Ian's insurer be liable for the claim?
A. It would be liable for one half of the claim.
B. It would be liable for the claim in full.
C. It would only be liable for the portion of the claim caused by the storm.
D. It would not be liable for the claim at all.

Answer: B
Explanation: When two concurrent perils combine to cause a loss and neither alone would cause it (interdependent causes), and one is insured whilst the other is merely uninsured (not excluded), the insured peril is the proximate cause and the claim is paid in full. If the design fault were an excluded peril, the claim would fail. But an uninsured peril doesn't defeat a claim where an insured peril operates concurrently. This follows the principle from Wayne Tank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 33 [Learning Outcome 8.7]
Harry owns a vintage car which he insures on an agreed value basis. An expert valuation was accepted at inception. When the car was subsequently written off, why did Harry receive less than indemnity?
A. The loss adjuster appointed by the insurer subsequently disputed the expert's valuation.
B. An equivalent replacement was available at a lower price.
C. The market value of an equivalent car had decreased.
D. The market value of an equivalent car had increased.

Answer: D
Explanation: Even under an agreed value policy, the insured cannot receive more than a full indemnity (cannot profit from the loss). If the market value has increased above the agreed value, the agreed value is paid. But if an equivalent replacement can be obtained for less than the agreed value, only the lower actual indemnity is paid – the insured must be put back in the same position, not bettered. The loss adjuster cannot dispute an agreed valuation for being too high, only apply the indemnity principle if replacement costs less.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 34 [Learning Outcome 8.6]
When Fred's yacht ran aground on rocks, but was NOT totally destroyed, he abandoned his rights to the yacht to his insurer. However, he did NOT serve a formal notice of abandonment on the insurer. If Fred submits a claim, the insurer is entitled to classify it as
A. an actual total loss.
B. a constructive total loss.
C. a partial loss.
D. salvage.

Answer: C
Explanation: A constructive total loss in marine insurance requires: (1) the vessel is not actually destroyed, but (2) the cost of recovery/repair would exceed its value, and (3) the insured serves a formal notice of abandonment on the insurer. Without valid notice of abandonment, the claim can only be treated as a partial loss, even if the vessel is effectively beyond economic repair. The insurer is not obliged to accept abandonment informally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 35 [Learning Outcome 8.6]
Which type of insurance CANNOT have its annual limit of liability exhausted by a series of partial losses?
A. An employers' liability policy.
B. Motor third party bodily injury cover.
C. A theft cover on stock.
D. A products liability policy.

Answer: B
Explanation: Motor third party insurance under the Road Traffic Act 1988 must provide unlimited cover for third party bodily injury. This limit cannot be exhausted – it applies per accident, not per policy year. Employers' liability, products liability, and property policies typically have annual aggregate limits that can be exhausted by multiple claims. The unlimited nature of motor TP injury cover is a statutory requirement to protect accident victims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 36 [Learning Outcome 9.3]
Following the case of Lister v. Romford Ice and Cold Storage Ltd (1957), insurers generally agreed to
A. give up their subrogation rights against workers who negligently injure their fellow employees in the course of employment.
B. pursue subrogation rights against directors on the grounds of vicarious liability.
C. use the independent liability method for the calculation of contribution.
D. waive their subrogation rights between subsidiary and associated companies of an insured.

Answer: A
Explanation: Lister v Romford established that insurers could pursue subrogation against employees whose negligence injured co-workers. However, insurers voluntarily agreed not to exercise these rights (except in cases of collusion) because: (1) it would damage industrial relations, (2) employees typically can't pay, (3) employers expect their EL insurance to be final. This gentlemen's agreement protects employees whilst preserving the legal right in cases of fraud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 37 [Learning Outcome 9.6]
Tina has an insurance policy which contains a contribution condition known as an escape clause. She takes out a second policy with another insurer, but despite the cover under the two policies overlapping, the original insurers do NOT avoid the policy using the escape clause. This is because
A. both policies have an escape clause so they will both contribute equally.
B. statute law prohibits the use of escape clauses.
C. Tina has notified both insurers of the double insurance.
D. Tina has obtained the consent of her insurers.

Answer: D
Explanation: An escape clause purports to allow an insurer to avoid liability entirely if other insurance exists covering the same risk. If both policies have escape clauses, they cancel out and both contribute. However, if the insured obtains the insurer's consent to taking out additional insurance, the escape clause cannot be invoked. Consent waives the insurer's right to rely on the clause. Mere notification isn't enough – consent is required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 38 [Learning Outcome 9.3]
An insurer is entitled to make a profit following an insured loss when
A. the property is abandoned by the insured.
B. contribution is received from another insurer.
C. subrogation rights are exercised.
D. settlement is by way of indemnity.

Answer: A
Explanation: When property is abandoned to the insurer (in marine insurance or constructive total loss situations), the insurer takes ownership and any salvage proceeds belong to the insurer. If salvage exceeds the claim paid, the insurer profits. Contribution merely shares the loss between insurers (no profit). Subrogation recoveries go first to the insured if they're underinsured, then to the insurer to recoup payment (no profit). Standard indemnity doesn't create profit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 39 [Learning Outcome 9.6]
Two liability policies with different insurers cover the same loss of £12,000. The limit of liability is £20,000 under policy X and £40,000 under policy Y. Neither policy is subject to average or has a non-contribution clause, but policy X is subject to a £4,000 excess. What amount will policy X contribute towards the claim payment?
A. £2,000
B. £4,000
C. £4,800
D. £7,200

Answer: C
Explanation: Using the maximum liability method: Policy X maximum liability = £20,000, Policy Y = £40,000. Total = £60,000. Policy X's share = (£20,000/£60,000) × £12,000 = £4,000. However, this doesn't account for the excess fairly. Using independent liability method: Policy X would pay £12,000 - £4,000 excess = £8,000 if alone. Policy Y would pay £12,000 if alone. Total = £20,000. Policy X pays (£8,000/£20,000) × £12,000 = £4,800. The independent liability method is fairer when excesses differ.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 40 [Learning Outcome 9.6]
An insurer has paid a policyholder for fire damage to his home caused by an electrician's faulty work, less the policy excess. How should any subrogation action for damages be brought against the negligent electrician and for what amount(s)?
A. By the insurer and the insured separately in their own names for the amount of the claim payment and the policy excess respectively.
B. By the insurer only in its own name for the amount of the claim payment and the policy excess.
C. By the insurer in the name of the insured for the amount of the claim payment only.
D. By the insurer in the name of the insured for the amount of the claim payment and the policy excess.

Answer: D
Explanation: Subrogation actions must be brought in the name of the insured (the party with the legal cause of action), not the insurer. The insurer controls the action but uses the insured's name. The action is for the full loss (insurer's payment plus the excess) because the insured bore the excess as an uninsured loss. If recovery exceeds the insurer's payment, the excess is recovered for the insured. One action recovers for both parties' interests.

MULTIPLE RESPONSE QUESTIONS (Q41-Q50)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 41 [Learning Outcome 1.2]
The UK Parliament consists of the (Select all that apply)
A. House of Commons.
B. House of Lords.
C. Monarchy.
D. Privy Council.
E. Supreme Court.

Answer: A, B, C
Explanation: The UK Parliament is composed of three elements: the House of Commons (elected representatives), the House of Lords (appointed and hereditary peers), and the Monarchy (the Sovereign, who gives Royal Assent to legislation). The Privy Council advises the monarch but is not part of Parliament. The Supreme Court is part of the judiciary, separate from the legislative branch (Parliament) under the separation of powers doctrine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 42 [Learning Outcome 1.5]
A 17-year-old in full-time education can (Select all that apply)
A. be fully responsible for his criminal actions.
B. be a beneficiary of a trust.
C. be a member of a jury.
D. make a valid will.
E. own a house outright.

Answer: A, B
Explanation: Criminal responsibility begins at age 10 in England and Wales, so a 17-year-old is fully responsible for criminal acts. Anyone can be a trust beneficiary regardless of age. However, jury service requires age 18 or over. Valid wills generally require the testator to be 18 (with exceptions for military personnel). Whilst minors can own property, legal title is typically held by trustees until they reach 18.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 43 [Learning Outcome 2.4]
Following a motor accident, an insured may be able to claim for special damages for (Select all that apply)
A. damage to clothing.
B. injury to feelings.
C. loss of earnings.
D. medical expenses.
E. pain and suffering.

Answer: A, C, D
Explanation: In tort law, damages are divided into special and general damages. Special damages are quantifiable financial losses that can be calculated precisely: damage to property (clothing), loss of earnings, and medical expenses. General damages cover non-quantifiable losses such as pain and suffering, loss of amenity, and injury to feelings. Understanding this distinction is important for insurance claims assessment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 44 [Learning Outcome 3.2]
In contract law, acceptance of an offer (Select all that apply)
A. may be achieved by taking no action.
B. may be implied by conduct.
C. may vary the terms of the offer.
D. must be made in writing.
E. must exactly match the terms of the offer.

Answer: B, E
Explanation: Acceptance must be a 'mirror image' of the offer – accepting different terms is a counter-offer, not acceptance. Acceptance can be implied by conduct (e.g., starting work) and doesn't need to be in writing unless the offer specifies this. Silence cannot constitute acceptance (though conduct following silence might). Varying terms creates a counter-offer rather than acceptance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 45 [Learning Outcome 4.3]
An agency will be automatically terminated (Select all that apply)
A. by lapse of time if the agreement was created for a specific period of time.
B. by mutual agreement of the parties.
C. by performance of the task specified in the agreement.
D. on bankruptcy of the agent.
E. on death of the principal.

Answer: A, C, E (Note: some exam versions may include B)
Explanation: An agency relationship terminates automatically in several situations: (1) lapse of time (if for a fixed period), (2) completion of the specific task, (3) death of either party (though some exceptions exist), (4) bankruptcy of the agent (affects their capacity to act), and (5) frustration of the agency. Mutual agreement terminates agency but requires positive action by both parties, so may not be classified as 'automatic' in the strictest sense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 46 [Learning Outcome 5.4]
Which material circumstances do NOT need to be disclosed by a manufacturing company in an insurance proposal? (Select all that apply)
A. Factors which lessen the risk.
B. Details about a trade which the insurers regularly underwrite.
C. Information which the insurer's risk survey should have revealed.
D. Unusual features of a risk that the insurer's standard survey would not reveal.

Answer: A, B, C
Explanation: Under the Insurance Act 2015, the insured need not disclose: (1) circumstances that reduce the risk, (2) matters of common knowledge, (3) matters the insurer knows or should know (including from their own surveys), (4) matters the insurer has waived, and (5) matters that are superfluous to disclose because of other facts disclosed. However, unusual features that a standard survey wouldn't reveal must be disclosed – the insurer can't be expected to discover hidden or unusual risks during a standard inspection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 47 [Learning Outcome 6.1]
Common law rules for the interpretation of insurance policies include the (Select all that apply)
A. application of a technical or legal meaning.
B. contra proferentum rule.
C. mischief rule.
D. golden rule.

Answer: A, B
Explanation: Common law rules for interpreting insurance contracts include: (1) Words are given their ordinary meaning unless a technical or legal meaning is intended. (2) Contra proferentem – ambiguities are construed against the drafter (usually the insurer). (3) The contract is read as a whole. (4) Effect is given to all clauses if possible. The mischief rule and golden rule are statutory interpretation rules used for legislation, not contracts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 48 [Learning Outcome 7.2]
What legal remedies are available to an insured who has suffered a loss as a result of an insurer's unreasonably late payment of a claim? (Select all that apply)
A. Contractual damages.
B. Interest on any sums due under the policy.
C. Punitive damages.
D. Specific performance.

Answer: A, B
Explanation: When an insurer delays payment unreasonably, the insured can claim: (1) Contractual damages for losses caused by the delay (e.g., interest charges, business losses). (2) Interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 or at the court's discretion. Punitive (exemplary) damages are rarely awarded in contract cases. Specific performance (an order to perform the contract) is unavailable once the insurer has accepted liability – damages are adequate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 49 [Learning Outcome 8.3]
Which insurance terms and conditions can reduce a policyholder's entitlement to a full indemnity following a loss? (Select all that apply)
A. An average clause.
B. An insuring clause.
C. A policy excess.
D. A subrogation clause.

Answer: A, C
Explanation: Terms that reduce indemnity include: (1) Average (underinsurance) clauses – proportionately reduce payment if sum insured is inadequate. (2) Excesses/deductibles – the insured bears the first portion of each loss. The insuring clause defines what is covered (doesn't reduce indemnity). Subrogation clauses preserve the insurer's rights to recover from third parties (don't reduce the insured's indemnity).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 50 [Learning Outcome 9.2]
An insurer's subrogation rights may arise (Select all that apply)
A. following an ex gratia payment.
B. in contract.
C. in the tort of negligence.
D. under estoppel.
E. under statute.

Answer: B, C, E
Explanation: Subrogation rights arise from: (1) Contract – the insurance contract itself and any contract between the insured and third party. (2) Tort – when the loss was caused by a third party's tortious conduct (e.g., negligence). (3) Statute – some statutes create or modify subrogation rights (e.g., Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Acts). Ex gratia payments are voluntary payments outside the policy terms, creating no subrogation rights. Estoppel prevents a party from denying something but doesn't create subrogation rights.
